            I am interested in understanding the mechanistic basis of neurobiological learning. To this extent, my research focuses on how synapses, neurons, and microcircuits undergo experience dependent change to give rise to intelligence. Currently, I am investigating how dendritic plateau potentials drive a powerful form of synaptic plasticity as a Ph.D. candidate in the lab of <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee</a>.
