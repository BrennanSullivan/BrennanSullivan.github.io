                  I am interested in improving our understanding of the mechanistic basis of neurobiological learning. To this extent, I leverage experimental approaches to investigate the learning rules that underlie neurobiological intelligence. Currently, I am investigating how dendritic plateau potentials drive synaptic plasticity as a Ph.D. candidate in the lab of <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee</a>.
