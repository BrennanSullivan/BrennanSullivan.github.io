      I am interested in the mechanistic basis of neurobiological learning and adaptive behavior. My primary level of investigation is at the intersection between neuronal biophysics and systems neuroscience to understand how experiences alter the input-output transformations of neurons. To this end, I employ experimental approaches to investigate the brain’s learning rules. Learning poses a challenge for any intelligent system, whether biological or artificial. As a result, I maintain an interest in artificial learning rules and architectures.

      Currently, I am investigating how dendritic plateau potentials drive synaptic plasticity as a Neuroscience Ph.D. candidate in the lab of <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee</a>. Before graduate school, I developed therapeutic targets for pediatric epilepsy and intellectual disability in the laboratory of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BsgifUUAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=10220790398908802146">Shilpa Kadam</a> at the Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As an undergraduate in Neuroscience, I investigated A-type K+ channel function and pharmacology in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/kelly-dougherty">Kelly Dougherty</a> at Rhodes College.
