      I am interested in the mechanistic basis of intelligence in the mammalian brain. One important aspect of intelligence is the ability for the brain to learn from experience. Currently, I am investigating how synaptic plasticity produces learning-related changes in neuronal representations as a Ph.D. candidate in <a href = https://themageelab.com/>Jeff Mageeâ€™s lab</a>.
