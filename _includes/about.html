          I am currently a PhD candidate in Jeff Magee’s lab where I study the mechanisms underlying learning in the brain. Previously, I received a B.S. in Neuroscience from Rhodes College where I worked in the physiology and biophysics lab of Kelly Dougherty studying voltage gated ion channels. Before graduate school, I performed postbaccalaureate research in Shilpa Kadam’s laboratory at Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where I worked to develop rational therapies for pediatric epilepsy and intellectual disability.
