        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee's Lab</a> investigating neural mechanisms of learning in the mammalian neocortex. My approach is to use intracellular and extracellular electrical recordings in behaving mice to distinguish between proposed models of neocortical circuit function and synaptic plasticity.</p>

    <p>Previously, I worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BsgifUUAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=10220790398908802146">Shilpa Kadam</a> at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University to develop rationale therapies for pediatric epilepsy and intellectual disability. Before that, I graduated from Rhodes College with a B.S. in Neuroscience and was introduced to membrane biophysics and dendritic integration in the lab of <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/kelly-dougherty">Kelly Dougherty</a>. For more, please see <a href="https://brennansullivan.info/cv.pdf">my CV</a>.
