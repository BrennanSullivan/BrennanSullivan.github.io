     I am interested in the mechanistic basis of intelligence in the mammalian brain. An important aspect of intelligence is the ability for the brain to learn from experience to produce adaptive behavior. One powerful mechanism for learning is synaptic plasticity, the experience-dependent change in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Currently, I am investigating how synaptic plasticity produces learning-related changes in neuronal representations with the team in <a href = https://themageelab.com/>Jeff Magee’s lab</a>.

     Previously, I received a B.S. in Neuroscience from Rhodes College where I studied voltage-gated ion channels in the neurophysiology and biophysics lab of <a href = https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/kelly-dougherty > Kelly Dougherty</a>. Before graduate school, I worked to develop rationale therapies for pediatric epilepsies in the lab of <a href = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shilpa-Kadam-3 > Shilpa Kadam</a> at Kennedy Krieger Children’s Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
