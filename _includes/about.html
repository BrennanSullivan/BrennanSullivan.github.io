     I am interested in the mechanistic basis of intelligence in the mammalian brain. An important aspect of intelligence is the ability for the brain to learn from experience to produce adaptive behaviors. One powerful mechanism for learning is synaptic plasticity, the experience-dependent change in the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. Currently, I am investigating how synaptic plasticity produces learning-related changes in neuronal representations in <a href = https://themageelab.com/>Jeff Mageeâ€™s lab</a>.
