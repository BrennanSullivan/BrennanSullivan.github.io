         I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee's Lab</a> investigating neural mechanisms of learning in the mammalian neocortex. My approach is to use intracellular and extracellular electrical recordings in behaving mice to distinguish between proposed models of circuit function and synaptic plasticity. To this end, I am pursuing ways to combine my experimental work with the development of computational models to establish an iterative experiment-theory framework.
