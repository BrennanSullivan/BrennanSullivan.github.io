      I am interested in the mechanistic basis of neurobiological learning and adaptive behavior. My primary level of investigation is at the intersection between neuronal biophysics and systems neuroscience to understand how experiences alter the input-output transformations of neurons. Learning poses a challenge for any intelligent system, whether biological or artificial. As a result, I maintain an interest in artificial learning rules and architectures.

      Currently, I am investigating how dendritic plateau potentials drive synaptic plasticity as a Ph.D. candidate in the laboratory of <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee</a> at Baylor College of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Before graduate school, I developed therapeutic targets for pediatric epilepsy and intellectual disability in the laboratory of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BsgifUUAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=10220790398908802146">Shilpa Kadam</a> at Kennedy Krieger Childrenâ€™s Hospital and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Before that, I investigated A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel function and pharmacology as an undergraduate in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.rhodes.edu/bio/kelly-dougherty">Kelly Dougherty</a> at Rhodes College.
