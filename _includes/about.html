        I am a PhD candidate in the laboratory of <a href="https://themageelab.com/">Jeff Magee</a> at Baylor College of Medicine. My current research investigates the mechanistic basis of neurobiological learning and adaptive behavior. My primary focus is on the synaptic organization of neocortical circuits and their forms of synaptic plasticity.
