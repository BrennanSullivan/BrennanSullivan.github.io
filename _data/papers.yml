    briefly: "Neonatal seizures are often associated with resistance to antiseizure drugs. In a neonatal mouse model, we found that enhancing the chloride co-transporter KCC2 reduced seizures. KCC2 abundance and phosphorylation were necessary for these effects. These findings suggest that KCC2 may be a potential therapeutic target for neonatal seizures."

    briefly: "Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. In our study, we established the sleep dysfunction and epilepsy phenotype in a haploinsufficient mouse model. Administering an AMPA receptor antagonist, Perampanel, reduced seizures and restored EEG activity in mice."
