    briefly: "Neonatal seizures are often associated with cerebral ischemia and resistance to antiseizure drugs. We found that acutely enhancing KCC2 activity reduced seizures in a neonatal mouse model. These effects depended on KCC2 abundance and phosphorylation. The findings demonstrate the potential of KCC2 as a target for treating phenobarbital-resistant pediatric seizures."
