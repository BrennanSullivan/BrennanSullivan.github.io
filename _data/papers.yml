    briefly: "Neonatal seizures are often associated with resistance to antiseizure drugs. We found that enhancing KCC2 activity reduced seizures in a neonatal mouse model. KCC2 abundance and phosphorylation were necessary for these effects. These findings demonstrate the potential of KCC2 as a target for neonatal seizures."

    briefly: " Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. SYNGAP1 is crucial for the formation and regulation of dendritic spines. In our study, we established the sleep dysfunction and epilepsy phenotype in a mouse model. The administration of a low dose of an AMPA receptor antagonist, perampanel, reduced seizures and restored cortical gamma activity. "

    briefly: "During prolonged neonatal seizures, excessive activation of the BDNF receptor kinase, TrkB, is associated with the development of refractory seizures. Using a chemical-genetic mouse model, we found that TrkB activation increases postischemic seizure susceptibility in the neonatal brain. However, unlike TrkB antagonists, TrkB agonists exhibit a nonlinear dose-response curve with higher doses actually reducing seizures."
