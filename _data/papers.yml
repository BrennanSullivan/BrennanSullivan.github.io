    briefly: "During a delayed response task in mice, two populations of neurons represent competing choices in the frontal cortex and the downstream superior colliculus. We found an interhemispheric circuit mechanism that drives push-pull dynamics between competing choices in the superior colliculus, and that the output of the superior colliculus biases frontal cortex choice activity. These findings challenge models that suggest that decisions are formed in the frontal cortex and inherited by the superior colliculus."

    briefly: "Neonatal seizures are often associated with resistance to antiseizure drugs. In a neonatal mouse model, we found that enhancing the chloride co-transporter KCC2 reduced seizures. KCC2 abundance and phosphorylation were necessary for these effects. These findings demonstrate the potential of KCC2 as a therapeutic target for neonatal seizures."

    briefly: "Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. SYNGAP is crucial for dendritic spine formation and the regulation of AMPA receptor insertion into the postsynaptic membrane. In our study, we established the sleep dysfunction and epilepsy phenotype in a haploinsufficient mouse model. Administering an AMPA receptor antagonist, Perampanel, reduced seizures and restored cortical gamma activity on EEG in mice. Interestingly, Perampanel has demonstrated efficacy in SYNGAP1 patients and epilepsy patients with pathogenic variants related to glutamatergic synaptic transmission (Nissenkorn et al. 2023, Epilepsia; Gupta et al. 2023, Front. Neurol.)."

    briefly: "Photoacoustic imaging is capable of noninvasive imaging by combining near-infrared light excitation and ultrasound detection. Using a near-infrared cyanine voltage sensitive dye and photoacoustic imaging, we demonstrate the ability to monitor voltage dynamics with sub-mm spatial resolution through an intact skull. This approach is an experimental imaging modality, and can be compared to EEG with improved spatial resolution but poorer temporal resolution."

    briefly: "During prolonged neonatal seizures, excessive activation of the BDNF receptor kinase, TrkB, is associated with the development of refractory seizures. Using a chemical-genetic mouse model, we found that TrkB activation increases postischemic seizure susceptibility in the neonatal brain. However, unlike TrkB antagonists, TrkB agonists exhibit a nonlinear dose-response curve with higher doses reducing seizures."

    briefly: "During prolonged neonatal seizures, excessive activation of the BDNF receptor kinase, TrkB, is associated with the development of refractory seizures. We found that the TrkB antagonist, ANA-12, effectively prevented the development of refractory neonatal seizures in a mouse model. A notable difference between the sexes was observed, with females responding better than males."
